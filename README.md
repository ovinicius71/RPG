# 1 Introduction
This repository contains the extension of a role-playing game project (Role-Playing Game) developed for the Object-Oriented Programming Language (LPOO) discipline. The main objective of this project is to apply the concepts learned during the course, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and use of design patterns, in a practical context.
## 2 objective 
The objective of this work is to implement a system in Java programming language
of combat in an RPG game (Role Playing Game). To achieve this, the possibility of choosing between three main characters must be implemented, each having weapons and skills.
unique.
### 3 Learning Objective
- Implement classes and objects efficiently.
- Use inheritance to create complex class hierarchies.
- Apply polymorphism to make the behavior of objects more flexible and expand.
- Encapsulate data and functionality to ensure code integrity and modularity.
- Adopt design patterns to solve recurring problems in software development.
